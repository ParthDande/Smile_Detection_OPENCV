# Smile Detection

This repository hosts the Smile Detection project, which utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers to detect human faces and smiles through a computer camera. 
The application is designed to identify facial features in real-time, providing a simple and interactive way to engage with computer vision technology.
The codebase is structured for easy understanding and can be adapted for various use cases that require facial feature recognition.
